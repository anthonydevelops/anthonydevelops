# Anthony Campos --@anthonydevelops

Hi, I'm Anthony--a Publisher Integration Engineer at Epsilon working on resolving publisher issues and creating internal tools to support the media team. A list of software/languages I use on the daily include: SQL, Postman, DBVisualizer, and JIRA. On my free-time, I dabble in creating fun projects or playing games like Pokemon Go or League of Legends. Reach out if you ever want to talk about software or are curious when I'll ever finish a side project.

### Interests

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **a site for my friends where we coach people to be slightly better at League of Legends**
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **more about microservices**
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on creating fun projects that might revolve around interesting APIs or, better yet, the Poke API. Also, designing APIs are really fun, so add that one in too

### My Values

- Honesty and trust
- Compassion for those around you
- Curiosity like you're always the new one
- Treat others like you'd like to be treated

### How I Work

A mix of inuitiveness, putting in the work to think out the problem, always googling, and when really stuck on what else I could do, reach out to the amazing team around me.
